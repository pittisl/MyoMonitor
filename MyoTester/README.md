# Init Commit
This is the App instructing muscle workouts for fatigue monitoring

# v0.0
All basic functions work well

# v0.1
Add a information page, the app save the information as folder name and store the pcm files in it.

Add voice instructions(but in very small volume)

Add the results page with time reminder of next group

# v0.2
Instead of saving only 1 record per workout, we save 5 corresponding to 5 steps
of the workout. This could resolve the volume issue by playing intermittently
with both speakers

The global volume will be set max during the workout activity

The physical volume up and down button now can also flag the start and stop 
of the test

Add a warm-up count down at each time of hitting the start button

If the use press back at the results page, it will back to the main page

After each group, it will ask whether you want to keep the last workout
(as it can be badly done)

# v0.3
All functions are done, ready to release

Changes:

1) Add the vibration to notify the stop of test.
2) Forbid screen rotation in the most activities.
3) Saved file name starts from 01 instead of 1
